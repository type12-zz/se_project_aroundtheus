# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
"Around the US" was made to display my understanding of combining css flexbox and css grid. Flexbox was use as the container for majority of the website except for the cards section which use grid to allow a more robust way of transitions the card elements according to the device screen width.

**Technologies**

HTML, CSS
  
**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
